HiddenRolls

HiddenRolls is a package of commands for hiding roll information in various
ways.  Inline rolls can be modified to display only the total (hiding the
formula), only the roll values (hiding the formula and totals), or only the
formula (whispering the totals to the GM).

It is recommended that this script be used in conjunction with the CommandShell
module, which will improve output formatting and command discovery.


Commands:

    !hideroll [options] command
    !hiderolls [options] command
	Replaces all inline rolls in command with their respective totals.

    !hidetotal [options] command
    !hidetotals [options] command
	Replaces all inline rolls in command with new expressions containing
	only the dice from the original expressions (i.e. no bonuses or
	annotations).  The full expression (with totals) is whispered to the GM.

    !hideall [options] command
	Forwards command to the GM.  Whispers command to the sender, with all
	inline rolls removed (and replaced with their respective formulas).

The above commands accept the following options:

    -h, --help		Displays a help message and exits.

    -v, --verbose	Generates additional output, depending on the command:
			    !hideroll(s):	Whispers full results (including
			    			rolls and formulas) to the GM.
			    !hidetotal(s):	Whispers full results to the
			    			sender in addition to the GM.
			    !hideall:		Sends the stripped command to
			    			global chat instead of
						whispering it to the sender.


Notes:

In order to guarantee the integrity of roll results, the Roll20 API does not
provide a way to insert roll results into an inline roll.  As a result,
HiddenRolls displays dice results as "{1d0+V1+V2+...}[XdY] ", where V1, V2, etc.
are roll values and XdY is the dice expression.  For example, "[[1d20+7]]" would
be displayed as "[[{1d0+12}[1d20] +7]]".  The "1d0" allows the expression to
function like a dice expression (otherwise the label would generate errors in
certain conditions), and the label allows the GM to verify the roll formula.


Examples:

Below are some example commands, along with the chat commands they will
generate.  Note that the whispers below are sent by the API, so they will not
appear in the sender's chat log unless they are the target of the whisper.

!hideroll The ogre swings its club ([[1d20+7]] to hit), doing [[2d6+5]] damage
    The ogre swings its club ([[19]] to hit), doing [[13]] damage

!hiderolls -v The fireball explodes for [[5d6]] damage
    The fireball explodes for [[17]] damage
    /w gm The fireball explodes for [[{1d0+1+3+6+5+2}[5d6] ]] damage

!hidetotal The troll makes a toughness save: [[1d20+8]]
    The troll makes a toughness save: [[{1d0+15}[1d20] +0[hidden] ]]
    /w gm The troll makes a toughness save: [[{1d0+15}[1d20] +8]]

!hidetotals -v The enchanter's spell does [[2d8+2]] damage
    The enchanter's spell does [[{1d0+7+3}[2d8] +0[hidden] ]] damage
    /w gm The enchanter's spell does [[{1d0+7+3}[2d8] +2]] damage
    /w Tim The enchanter's spell does [[{1d0+7+3}[2d8] +2]] damage

!hideall Slipping stealthily into a sneaky stance: [[1d20+12]]
    /w gm Slipping stealthily into a sneaky stance: [[1d20+12]]
    /w Snake Slipping stealthily into a sneaky stance: [1d20+12]
	Note the single brackets: the expression is not an inline roll, and is
	present only to display the formula being rolled.

!hideall -v Is it live or is it Magicex? [[1d20+8]] will save.
    /w gm Is it live or is it Magicex? [[1d20+8]] will save.
    Is it live or is it Magicex? [1d20+8] will save.
	Note the single brackets: the expression is not an inline roll, and is
	present only to display the formula being rolled.

!hideall &{template:default} {{name=Skill Check}} {{Hide=[[1d20+12]]}}
    /w gm &{template:default} {{name=Skill Check}} {{Hide=[[1d20+12]]}}
    /w Snake {template:default} {{name=Skill Check}} {{Hide=[1d20+12]}}
