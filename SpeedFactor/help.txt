Speed Factor Initiative:

1. DM selects tokens to be in intiative, and calls !sfstart. All tokens will be added to initiative with a value of "?". 
(For best results, these tokens should be attached to a character sheet with at least a size and a dexterity score.)

2. Menus appear for each player. They select actions by clicking the appropriate button. NPC menus will be sent to the DM.
Once all PCs and NPCs have selected actions, their initiative bonus will appear in place of "?" in the turn order.

3. DM calls "!sfroll" and the initiative dice are rolled and turns are ordered.

Utility functions:
!sfround sets up a new round using the tokens that are currently in the initiative order
!sfadd allows you to add selected tokens to the existing turnorder.
